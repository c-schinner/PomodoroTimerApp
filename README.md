# Pomodoro Timer App using Tkinter
The Pomodoro Timer App using Tkinter is a Python application designed to help users manage their work and productivity using the Pomodoro Techniqueâ€”a time management method that involves focused work periods (work sessions) followed by short breaks. This application provides a visual timer with customizable work and break durations.

# Features
Utilizes the Pomodoro Technique to improve productivity and focus.

Customizable work session, short break, and long break durations.

Displays a visual timer countdown using a graphical tomato image.

Keeps track of completed work sessions and breaks.

Simple and user-friendly interface.

# Usage
1. Make sure you have Python and the Tkinter library installed on your system.

2. Download or copy the provided code into a Python file (e.g., pomodoro_timer_app.py).

3. Place the "tomato.png" image in the same directory as the main file.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.

5. Run the app by executing the following command:

        python pomodoro_timer_app.py

6. The app window will appear with the initial timer set to the work session duration.

7. Click the "Start" button to begin the work session countdown. The timer will display the remaining time in minutes and seconds.

8. When the work session ends, the timer will automatically switch to the short break. The "Timer" label will change color to indicate the type of session.

9. Click the "Start" button again to begin the break countdown.

10. After completing several work sessions, the "Completion" label will show a visual representation of completed sessions using "I" symbols.

11. Click the "Reset" button to stop the current session and reset the timer.

# Customization and Extensibility
You can customize the durations of the work session, short break, and long break by modifying the WORK_MIN, SHORT_BREAK_MIN, and LONG_BREAK_MIN constants in the code.

Feel free to modify the appearance of the app, such as fonts, colors, and layout, to match your preferences.

# Note
This app is designed for educational purposes and as a demonstration of creating interactive applications using Tkinter.

It does not include all possible features of a comprehensive Pomodoro timer app.

The provided code does not include extensive error handling or input validation. 

In a production setting, you would want to implement proper error handling to ensure the application behaves as expected.
